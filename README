HelmQA - Quality and consistency checks of Helm charts
(originally: "similaritymetrics" to compare Helm charts semantically)

This directory is a collection of Helm chart analysis scripts and reference
data produced by the scripts on KubeApps Hub in May 2018. The following list
describes which files are used how.

The marker '#' stands for files generated by scripts which are not meant to be in the repository.
